# Stroke Prediction Project

This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of a stroke using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is the **Stroke Prediction Dataset**, which contains health-related features such as age, gender, and medical history. The goal is to apply different machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and visualize the results to help make informed predictions regarding stroke risks.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a person is likely to have a stroke based on certain health-related attributes. The dataset includes features like age, hypertension status, heart disease status, marital status, and work type. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, are applied to the data to assess their performance.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize the features to ensure consistent scaling across all variables.

2. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Use visualizations to understand the distribution of different features, such as age, glucose levels, and whether the person has hypertension or heart disease.
   - Visualize the correlation between features to understand how they relate to each other.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: 
   - Implement multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a stroke, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Naive Bayes
     - Random Forest
   - Evaluate the performance of these models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

4. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Assess the performance of each model using classification metrics.
   - Visualize the confusion matrix for the best-performing model to understand the classification results.
   - Choose the best model based on evaluation metrics for further analysis.

5. **Time Series Regression (Optional)**: 
   - Optionally, explore the use of time series regression to predict stroke outcomes over time based on the dataset (though this step is not mandatory).

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is implemented in Python, using libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is executed and presented through a Jupyter notebook, which allows for interactive data analysis and visualization.

## Results & Insights

After evaluating the models, we obtain performance metrics such as:
- **Accuracy**: How often the model predicts the correct result.
- **Precision**: How many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive.
- **Recall**: How many of the actual positive cases were correctly predicted.
- **F1-Score**: A balance between Precision and Recall.

The best-performing model is selected based on these metrics and can be used to make informed predictions about whether a person is likely to experience a stroke in the future.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for stroke prediction, starting from data preprocessing, applying multiple algorithms, and evaluating their performance. It highlights the importance of choosing the right model based on evaluation metrics and offers insights into how machine learning can be used in healthcare prediction tasks.
